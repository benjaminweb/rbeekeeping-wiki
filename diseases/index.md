# Disease Fact Sheets

Here's a list of diseases you might want to know about. Similarly to knowing the symptoms of anaphylaxis, so you know if you are having an allergic response, knowing the symptoms of diseases in your colony is crucial for spotting them early and dealing with them.

**Warning:**AFB and EFB are, depending on your jurisdiction, notifiable dieases. That means that you might be legally obligated to tell the government about cases of these diseases so that they can aid you in eradicating it. In some locations, if you do not notify them, you may be subject to fines or imprisonment. As a beekeeper, you have legal responsibilities that you need to be aware of - please follow the law to keep your bees, and everyone elses bees, healthy and happy.
