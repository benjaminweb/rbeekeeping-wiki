|   | Brood comb appearance | Age of dead brood | Colour and shape of dead brood | Consistency of dead brood | Odour of brood | Dried remains (scale) |
| ----- | ------ | ---- |------| -------------- |------| ----------|
|American foulbrood|Normal cell cappings, sunken dark, perforated cappings, or cappings completely removed|Prepupae or young pupae|Off white, then coffee brown, then black. Even coloured. Lose segmented outline 	|Smooth rope 10-30mm. Elastic thread "snap back" when breaks. Difficult to remove larval remains|Like dead fish|On bottom side of cell, hard to remove, pupal tongue can often be seen|
|Sacbrood 	|Cappings same as AFB 	|Prepupae only 	|Grey or yelow then brown, sometimes with a grey or black head. Segmented outline present 	|Plastic sac, watery contents of sac often lumpy. Sometimes ropes to small extent. Prepupae easily removed from the cell 	|Slightly sour 	|Dark brown, easily removed in one piece. No tongue but prepupal head may be curled up. Scales not common, except in severe infections|
|Chalkbood 	|Cappings same as AFB 	|Prepupae only 	|White (often with a yellow head), or black 	|Soft, furry, filling cells, hexagonal shape. Later shrinking to hard chalky mummies 	|Not noticeable 	|White or black, hard, easily removed mummies|
|Parasitic mite syndrome 	|Cappings same as AFB 	|Older larvae and prepupae (not pupae) 	|White, grey or yellow. Dried remains may be orange 	|Watery, pasty; does not rope; dries to scale. Presence of varroa sometimes observed 	|Sometimes sour urine-like 	|Twisted up the wall of the cell. Sometimes curled around the entrance. Easily removed from cell. No tongue present|
|Half-moon syndrome 	|Cappings same as AFB. Multiple eggs in cells, eggs attached in chains, and sometimes drone brood in worker cells 	|Young larvae to older sealed larva 	|Off white to dark brown. Trachea may be seen as dark lines in larvae 	|Watery, pasty; does not rope 	|Sour urine-like 	|Twisted up the wall of the cell. Sometimes curled around the entrance. Easiliy removed from cell.
