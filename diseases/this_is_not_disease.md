# This Is Not A Disease

A section dedicated to answering all the questions of very normal things beekeepers find in their hive and think "Oh no". These are all accompanied by lots of pictures where possible, so that you know what "normal" looks like.

## Bee Bread

This is not AFB, EFB, or Chalkbrood. It's bee bread. It's pollen that's been packed into a cell with saliva and a spot of nectar, and left to ferment. Granted, it does look like chalk, and also tastes a bit like chalk too... 

It's edible (aside from the pesticides), and importantly, it's not a disease. The bees use this as a protein source to feed their young. [You can actually buy tools to "sample" the bee bread.](https://www.thorne.co.uk/packaging-hive-products/pollen-royal-jelly-propolis/pollen-picker.html) If you've never tasted it, why don't you give it a go... it's not bad.
