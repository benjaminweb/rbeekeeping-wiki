> An brief overview of the format of an Ask Me Anything.

You've probably been sent this as part of an email thread about featuring you as an AMA guest, so if you have any questions, email us back there.

## The Format

In a regular Q&A, people raise their hand to ask questions to the speaker, and the speaker has a limited amount of time to pick out questions from the audience. An AMA gives essentially unlimited time for users to ask questions, but a limited amount of time for the guest to answer them. 

The format, quite simply, goes something like this:
1. You post your "AMA" post to the [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/beekeeping) some 6-12 hours before the scheduled time
1. Users will populate your post with questions in the comments during that time
1. You come back at the scheduled time, and answer as many questions as you'd like to for the alloted time (or longer if you prefer)

This means that for 6-12 hours users can ask as many questions as they like, about whatever they like. 

## Set up

At least a few days before the scheduled date, send us your reddit account handle so that we can properly "flair" your user and add it to the approved user list. This helps prevent your comments getting stuck in spam filters and makes sure users know that you are who you say you are. 

## How long does it take? 

From past AMAs, we estimate that a good *starting* point is 1-2 hours. Some guests spent 3-4 hours answering questions simply because they enjoyed it so much. Other guests spent much less time.

## But I don't know how reddit works

That's okay. We'll help you through that too. If any of this is alien to you or you simply want a hand, let the moderators know on the email thread and someone will gladly hop on a call with you to walk you through it, even if it's just a case of getting familiar with the platform before the AMA.

If you need help with any of the following, there's some tips here:

* [Setting up your account](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060420092-How-do-I-sign-up-for-a-Reddit-account)
  * Remember that you can only set your username once! Make it worthwhile :) 

* Making a post:
  1. Head to [the subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/beekeeping)
  1. Click ["Create Post"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/submit/?type=TEXT) (or just click this link)
  1. Give it title, something like: "I'm [name] from [somewhere]... Ask My Anything"
  1. Add some information to your post. Include pseudonyms, links to socials etc. We've included a template below.
  1. Click "Add flair" and pick any of them, just to allow you to post (we'll change this for you)
  1. Click "Post", or schedule it for 12 hours before the start time of the AMA.

* Replying to comments:
  * Reddit doesn't automatically update as comments post, so you will need to refresh the page occasionally
  * To reply to a comment, just click "reply" underneath it and it'll open a reply window for you
 

## Post example:

It's a good idea to include:
* **Name** - Including well known psuedonyms
* **Background** - Include beekeeping history and any qualifications. Importantly, what brings you to the AMA - What is your area of speciality, if you have one.
* **Links** - Include links to academic research or social media
* Finish with "Ask me anything!"

Hi my name is Francois (Frank), from University of Paris.

I've been beekeeping for 20 years and working with UoP for the last 15 years. I have been beekeeping with my father since I was a boy, but decided that academia was where I needed to be. I am a master beekeeper, and finished my PhD in 2010 studying the effects of thunderstorms on hive aggression. <link to paper>

Since then, I started a Youtube and produce videos for hobbyists where I take academic papers and break them down into useable information for laypeople. 

You can find my youtube here: <link>

Ask me anything!```
