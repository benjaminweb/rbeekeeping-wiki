> Splitting (kind of), without increase!

There's an interesting part of bees that we haven't covered in the swarming section of this wiki, and that's Trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is the "spit swapping" part of colony communication. It's partly why aggressively splitting the brood nest can cause supersedures. It's also why the demaree method works. 

The Demaree method is similar to most other types of splits, in that we remove *almost* all the brood from the main colony. The only difference is that we do this inside the same hive as the rest of the colony. This manipulation is slightly more difficult to understand than others, so we will explain it after the main method below. 

If you want to understand why this works, read the [Swarm Control](/wiki/queen_events/swarming/swarm_control) page.

# Required Equipment

* A new brood box with frames (drawn or foundation, either is fine)
* 2 x Supers
* A queen excluder

# The method

1. Place the new brood box next to the hive
1. Remove 4 frames from the new brood box, set them aside
1. Open the hive and find the queen (or perform a [queen sieve manipulation](/wiki/queen_events/swarming/swarm_control#but-i-cant-find-her))
1. Place the queen, a frame of capped brood, and a frame of stores (so long as the top half will still have plenty) in the center of the new brood box.
    * **IMPORTANT: Go through BOTH brood boxes and destroy ALL queen cells. You cannot miss a single one.**
1. Use the frames you set aside in step 2 to completely fill both brood boxes.
1. Remove the old brood box from the hive stand and bottom board.
1. Place the *new* brood box containing the queen on the hive stand and bottom board. 
1. Place a queen excluder on the new brood box.
1. Place 2 supers on top of the queen excluder.
1. Place the old brood box on top. The hive, from bottom to top should now be: bottom board; new brood box; queen excluder; super; super; old brood box; crown board or inner cover; top cover. Leave the top entrance open so drones can leave -- they can't fit through the queen excuder.
1. **On the 3rd day after the manipulation:**
    1. Return to the hive, inspect the top box
    1. Remove *ALL* queen cells from the top box
1. **On the 7th day after the manipulation:**
    1. Return to the hive, inspect the top box
    1. Remove *ALL* queen cells from the top box

You should now be finished. You will need to wait 21 days for all the brood in the top box to emerge and head down into the bottom story hive. The top box can then be removed. It's always safe to ensure that there's *plenty* of unused space between the top box and the used space below it. That is to say, if they start filling supers, add more supers.

**IMPORTANT:** If you leave a single queen cell, they will cap it and swarm. The inspection on the 3rd day is to ensure that you didn't miss any swarm cells, as they'll be blindingly obvious by then. The inspection on 7th day is to render them "hopelessly" queenless (in their eyes). 

The way this works is this: the bees are too far apart from oneanother to pass Queen Manibular Pheromone (QMP) around the colony, effectively making the top half of the colony believe they are queenless. Flying bees will move down the hive to the entrance at the bottom floor, and brood/nurses will be upstairs, with not enough QMP travelling between each half to convince the broodful half that they have a queen. It's essentially a vertical pagden split, with automatic reuniting as nurses emerge and head to where there's brood - i.e. downstairs.
