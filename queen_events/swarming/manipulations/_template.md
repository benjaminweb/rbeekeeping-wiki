<<Note on flying bees may or may not be needed>>
Be aware that you either need to include frames of stores or feed them 1:1 syrup in the queenless hive. This side will ideally be heavily broodful and will have no flying bees (foragers) - their calorie needs will be high with no forage coming in. There's a risk of starvation, you need to manage it.
