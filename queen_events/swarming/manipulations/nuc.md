> Swarm quashing with queen removal

A nuc split is as easy as they come. The number 2 is all you need to remember. If you want to understand why this works, read the [Swarm Control](/wiki/queen_events/swarming/swarm_control) page.

# Required Equipment

* A nuc box with frames (foundation or drawn, either is fine)

Yes, that's it.

# The Method

You need 2 frames of brood, 2 frames of stores, and 2 blank frames

1. Place your nuc next to the hive
1. Remove the frames from the nuc
1. Find the queen and place her and the frame that she's on into the nuc
1. Add an extra frame of brood
1. Add 2 frames of stores
1. Add 2 blank frames (foundation or drawn)
1. Put the lid on the nuc
1. Backfill the original hive with blank frames
1. [Reduce swarm cells](/wiki/queen_events/swarming/manipulations/queen_cells)

*Note: Please read the reducing cells page. The manipulation isn't finished until you also follow that page.*

Be aware that the nuc will need either frames of stores or feed them 1:1 syrup. **There will be no foragers** in the split to bring in stores, so there's a risk of starvation that needs managing.
