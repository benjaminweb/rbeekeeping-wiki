# Honey Bee Biology

## Lifecycle

![image showing timeline of egg development](/images/egg-timeline.png)

| Stage | Drone (Male) | Worker (Female) | Queen (Female) |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------- |
|Egg|Laid in larger cells. Unfertilized. Develops for about **3 days.**|Laid in standard worker cells. Fertilized. Develops for about **3 days.**|Laid in specially constructed queen cells.  Fertilized. Develops for about **3 days.**|
|Larva|Fed royal jelly for the first few days, then bee bread. Larger and grows in larger cells. Larval stage lasts about **6.5 days.**|Fed royal jelly for the first few days, then a mixture of honey and pollen. Larval stage lasts about **6 days.**|Continuously fed royal jelly. Rapid growth. Larval stage lasts about **5.5 days.**|
|Pupa|Sealed in a cell and undergoes metamorphosis. Pupal stage lasts about **14.5 days.**|Sealed in a cell. Undergoes metamorphosis.  Pupal stage lasts about **12 days.**|Sealed in a special queen cell. Undergoes metamorphosis. Pupal stage lasts about **7.5 days.**|
|Adult|Primary role is to mate with a queen.  Does not forage or produce honey. Lifespan varies but typically short lived (weeks to a few months).|Performs various roles including nursing, foraging, and hive maintenance. Lifespan is typically a few months, but longer in winter bees.|Sole egg layer in the hive. Can live several years. Mates during early life and stores sperm.|

Table: *Caste lifecycles. Drones take ~24 days from egg laying to emergence, Queens ~16 days, and workers ~21 days.*

### Key takeaways
- The egg stage lasts around 3 days. During this phase, the genes are activated and the clumps of cells arrange themselves into a larval shape.
- The larval stage is summarised as "moulting [shedding of exoskeleton] and rapid growth".
- The pupal stage begins when the cell is capped; the larva moves into an upright position and begins spinning a thin cocoon from silk produced by its salivary glands.
    - This stage takes around 36 hours, and features the final shedding of the larval cuticle (also called the “prepupal stage” in literature)
- In the pupal stage, there are clumps of cells on the pupa that get activated and begin forming structures like the legs and wings.
- The end of the pupal stage is marked by hardening and colouration of the cuticle [exoskeleton].
- The emerging bee sheds its pupal cuticle, as it begins to leave from the cell. 
    - The shedding and emergence occur together. As a result parts of the cuticle are still attached to the emerging bee. As there is insufficient time for the cuticle to harden, the bees' exoskeleton is still soft. 
        - This is why for the first few days of life, an adult bee cannot fly or sting and is hairier and lighter in colour than her nest mates.
