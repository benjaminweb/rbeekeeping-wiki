# Phermones in a honey bee colony
*Advanced Topic*

**Buckle up, it's a long one.**

Honey bee have two forms of communication: mechanical and chemical. The former includes "piping", buzzing and waggle dancing. The latter relates to pheromones released by the brood and adult bees. Pheromones are signalling chemicals released by an animal (e.g. queen) to control the behaviour of other animals in the vicinity (e.g. workers and drones). A note: you'll see references to "primer" and "releaser" pheromones. Primer pheromones are compounds that impact the bee's physiology (e.g. suppression of worker egg laying from brood pheromones), whereas "releaser" pheromones influence their behaviour (e.g. increased pollen forage, also from brood pheromones). Remember, P for physiology (primer) and R for response (releaser).


## Brood Phermones
"Brood pheromone" is a blend of 10 fatty-acid esters, with the compounds being individually capable of triggering a degree of brood pheromone effects on adult bees. One signal of brood pheromone is "hunger". Upon detection, nurse bees are prompted to feed the larvae (bee bread or nectar), and foragers begin gathering pollen. The higher the pheromone concentrations, the larger the pollen loads, and the more nurse bees recruited for feeding activities. A combination of brood and queen pheromones contributes to the inhibition of worker bee ovary development. This prevents the emergence of egg-laying workers and maintains order in the hive; the colony's resources are dedicated to rearing bees from queen-laid eggs.

## Queen Pheromones
### Queen Mandibular Pheromone
The major colony pheromone is the queen mandibular pheromone. Mated queens have higher levels of queen mandibular pheromone, whereas virgin queens show a higher concentration of worker mandibular pheromones, (10-HDA & 10-HDAA). QMP maintains colony cohesion and signals Her Majesty's presence. During mating flights, the virgin queen relies on QMP (specifically, 9-ODA) to transmit her location for the drones to mate. Depending on colony size, it can become saturated with QMP from a few hours to a day. When a worker bee bearing QMP interacts with another worker (via feeding or grooming), they will pass the QMP to them, and that worker will go on to pass it to others until the entire hive is familiar with her scent.
### Queen Retinue Pheromone
Like QMP, the retinue pheromone is secreted by the mandibular gland and is responsible for attracting and retaining the clusters of worker bees that attend to her needs. A decline in retinue pheromone has been suggested as another factor that determines swarming behaviour.
### Dufour's Gland Pheromone
The Dufour's gland stimulates retinue behaviour, and establishes Her Majesty's reproductive dominance by helping suppress worker ovaries along with QMP. The Dufour's gland is located in the abdomen, clustered around the regions containing the sting sheath, venom and Koschevnikov glands. 

Previous research suggested that in queens, the gland provided eggs with a "queen-laid" scent, whereas it had defensive purposes in workers (lubricating the stinger). Further experiments showed that when eggs are marked with the queen's Dufour's gland pheromone, workers removed them more often than the untreated ones.
### Queen Tergal Gland Pheromone
"Tergites" are the openings between abdominal segments on the upper insect exoskeleton. Queens have six tergites, and her glands are located between tergals 3-5. Tergal gland are thought to be complementary to queen mandibular pheromone, assisting in worker bee attraction. Each compound alone can form a retinue, with attraction being strongest in combination
### Queen Footprint Pheromone
The tarsal gland (as oppose to "tergal") refers to a single layer of cells on the base of the bee's foot ("tarsus"). Queens secrete pheromones as she walks on comb. Along with the mandibular pheromone, they signal her presence to the hive and stops the construction of queen cups. Recall that swarm cells are built on the bottom edges. 

In crowded colonies, the queen is restricted to the center of the frames, never reaching the bottom bar. Can you see the link between the lack of queen footprints, and the production of swarm cells? Due to high colony densities, these bottom areas go untouched by the queens, triggering swarm cell construction by worker bees.

## Worker Pheromones
### Worker Mandibular Gland Pheromone
Unlike queens, workers mandibular glands produce 10-HDA & 10-HDAA. Workers can produce small amounts of the queen pheromone 9-ODA, as evident in queenless colonies; their laying workers have developed queen-like characteristics. In general, the worker mandibular gland pheromone levels increase as the rate of worker egg laying increases (Robinson and Huang 1998), peaking in hopelessly queenless colonies.

Worker mandibles produce 2-Heptanone, a component of the alarm pheromone. Despite having a lesser potency compared to the sting gland compounds, it could serve as an immobilising agent that accompanies biting behaviour. When Varroa mites or wax moth larvae are bitten, the 2-heptanone paralyses this too-small-to-sting pest
### Worker Nasonov Gland Pheromone
If you see workers bees standing with an elevated, pumping abdomen followed by fanning, then that's the Nasonov gland in action. It's located between the sixth and seventh abdominal tergites. The gland releases a blend of seven chemicals and has multiple functions, from swarming, hive entrance marking, identifying foraging sources, and helping the queen find her way back home.

When the first workers depart as part of swarm, those bees fan their Nasonov and direct the rest of the swarm to their temporary location. Later, the same scouts waggle dance to communicate the location of their new permanent home. They then return to that location and start fanning their Nasonov to lead the bees home.

In the field, forager bees use their Nasonov gland to attract other foragers to a source of water, or a plant with abundant forage. In experiments, a profitable forage was defined as one with the relatively highest sugar concentrations, making it the best source of nectar
### Alarm Pheromones: Worker Sting & Koschevnikov Glands
During defence, guard bees appear at the hive entrance, raising their abdomen and exposing the sting chamber to release alarm pheromones. They fan their wings simultaneously, dispersing the volatile components. These compounds signal actual or perceived dangers to the bee hive, and are released not just when exposing the stinger, but also during stinging, and when the barb is left in your (unfortunately- exposed) skin.

Alarm pheromones are produced by the Koschevnikov gland and gland-containing areas around the sting sheath. The active component of the sting alarm pheromone is isopentyal acetate ("IPA", not one you'd want to drink). Its release alerts other workers to commence defensive behaviours. The concentrations of IPA are nil in queens, and slowly develop in worker bees, peaking at 2-3 weeks of age when they begin guard duties. IPA is the main active component, but not the only one - others like 2-heptanol or 2-nonnal can trigger defensive behaviour, and the complete alarm pheromone is a blend of over 40 compounds.

The composition of the alarm pheromone is subspecies specific - [Africanised bees](https://rbeekeeping.github.io/wiki/biology/Africanized_honeybees) have higher levels of its component chemicals, and more IPA. This could be why they're so aggressive ("defensive") when triggered.
### Worker Tarsal Pheromone
Like queens, the workers have a footprint pheromone. Williams and colleagues suggest that it is a "close proximity" equivalent of the Nasonov gland, serving as a method of marking comb, the hive entrance and rich forage for nearby bees. The Nasonov is for long-distance marking, as demonstrated by its ability to guide swarms to their new home.
### Worker Tergal Gland Pheromones
In queenright colonies, the worker tergal glands are inactive, as the queen controls worker fertility. Once queenless, they are activated and used for establishing reproductive dominance amongst other bees.

False queens use the tergal gland pheromones to complete with her sisters, producing a number of queen-like compounds as well as some brood pheromones; perhaps part of the reason why their retinue feeds and tends the false queens more often?

## Drone Pheromones?
The male drones don't contribute much by way of pheromones. The drone's mandibular gland secrete a pheromone that aids other drones in finding (and forming?) the congregation areas. Drones also have a different tarsal gland structure, the purposes of which are (still) unknown. Given how little economic value there is in drones, I don't think we'll see funding for "drone tarsal gland research" anytime soon.

The drone mandibular gland produces pheromones until 7-8 days of age, when their mating flights commence. The drones release pheromones as they fly to the congregation areas, attracting other drones over long distances. Note that some of the compounds found in the drone mandibular glands overlap with those found in QMP (hexadecanoic, & octadecenoic acids).
## Colony-wide pheromones
Some pheromones are produced by all bee castes (ethyl olate), others are not specific to bees (wax comb).
### Ethyl Olate
Ethyl oleate delays the transition from nest bee to forager and is produced by the foragers as they ferment nectar. Rather than getting bees drunk, the compound is secreted from their exoskeleton to form a negative feedback loop:

When there are high number of foragers in a colony, the high ethyl oleate concentrations inhibit the maturation of young bees into foragers, maintaining a population of nurses or middle-aged workers. As foragers die, the pheromone concentration decreases and so the young bees become foragers.
### "Death" Pheromones
In death, it is the absence of chemical substances that signals a corpse, rather than the production of "death pheromones".

The loss of cuticular hydrocarbons signals a corpse. In life, these carbon-based compounds are constantly being produced and as part of the chemical signatures used in nestmate recognition. In the Asian honey bee Apis cerena, Wen and colleagues isolated two cuticular hydrocarbons, heptacosane and nonacosane, and found that reduced emissions of these compounds signals to undertakers that this was a dead bee.

Honey bees on the other hand, rely on a combination of esters and polar compounds to classify nestmates. Workers assigned to different tasks inside the hive, whether undertaking or cleaning, had similar but distinct cuticular hydrocarbon signatures, serving as a marker of their role in the hive.
