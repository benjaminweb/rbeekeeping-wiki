# Queen Rearing

*(times in age of egg if not otherwise specified)*

Queen rearing is the art of raising virgins and mating them to queens that have specific desirable traits.

A virgin queen develops from a worker egg, that is fertilised unlike a drone egg. It does only become a virgin queen if fed continuously with royal jelly, unlike a worker. Under swarming impulse, the queen lays eggs into queen cups (vertically oriented). While in case of a lost or failing queen the nurse bees decide to change the diet of some common worker larvae of ≤ 36 hours age (from hatching) to full royal jelly.

Thus, the simplest and most natural way to queen rearing is on a hive that is naturally producing swarm cells (filled with larvae), to  remove the queen with all but one swarm cell and distribute them over mating nucs. In such case, the cells are fed with best amount of royal jelly.

There are three different approaches how to raise queens:

- A. queen-right only colony: you put grafted cells in a top box above a queen excluder that is bursting off nurse bees (closest to natural swarming conditions)
- B. initially queen-less (starter-finisher): you start many cells in queen-less colony which you let finish in a queen-right colony, see description below
- always queenless colony: poorly fed with royal jelly, hence not considered

The following guide describes both the queen-right only and the starter finisher approach: how to artificially raise many queen cells from selected larvae and feed them well with royal jelly.

## A. Queen-right only (closest to natural swarm cells)

*summarised from [Wilkinson & Brown, National Bee Unit: Rearing Queen Honey Bees in Queenright Colony, 2002](https://www.nationalbeeunit.com/assets/PDFs/3_Resources_for_beekeepers/Rearing_Queen_Honeybees.pdf)*

### The Process
- Eight to 24 hours before first grafting:
	- put all sealed brood above queen excluder, have most of unsealed brood with queen below queen excluder (if queen is not found, shake combs free of bees before they are placed above queen excluder)
	- add graft frame with 12-24 empty plastic queen cups to top brood box (bees can polish cell cups and add small rim of beeswax to each & warm it to brood nest temperature)
	- put comb of pollen to top box close to graft bar
	- put comb of young larvae, preferably, also with some pollen stores, adjacent to the graft bar (to attract nurse bees to graft area; beware of larvae ≤ 36 hours to be turned into emergency cells, see below how to age brood)
	- if no reliable nectar flow: simulate by feeding one to two litres of 60% (w/w) sugar syrup (1 kg white granulated sugar per 650 ml water) per week either in frame feeder or contact feeder
- Grafting:
	- remove graft frame
	- colect young larvae from breeder colony
	- brush bees off the frames (rather than shaking to avoid dislodging the larvae)
	- (transport combs and graft-bars in box, graft somewhere inside protected from direct sun light and wind to prevent larvae from drying out)
	- pick worker larvae aged 12-18 hours from hatching (to ensure they have maximum time as larva to be reared as queen and yet also be large enough to be grafted with reasonable acceptance rates)
	- (to obtain large numbers of larvae of the right age for grafting, empty brood combs can be added to a breeder colony, or a breeder queen caged overnight on an empty comb (using queen excluder cage), four days prior to grafting
	- graft with either flexible 'spatula-like' tool, such as Chinese grafting tool (advantage: transfers a bed of royal jelly along with the larvae), or a solid metal tool, such as a dentist's excavator
	- (pick each larva up by approaching from the outer convex corve of its 'c' shape
	- return completed grafts to rearer colony as soon as possible
- 1-3 days after grafting: check for cell acceptance
	- each accepted larva is floating on a deep bed of royal jelly (and walls are extended with beeswax)
	- (at times first one or two batches of grafts might have poor acceptance, following ones have high acceptance rate again)
	- (if, however, poor graft acceptance rates, or started cells are destroyed: presence of second queen in upper box, damaged queen excluder allowing queen to move through)
- 6-7 days after grafting: shake all combs of brood in top box free of bees and destroy any such queen cells (can be combined with brood rotation)
- move queen cells before hatching into queenless nucleus colony without any delay, otherwise kept warm by bees or incubator inbetween

*(of course the grafting can be done with the breeder queen laying eggs into cups on a cell grid and you can let the virgins emerge in roller cages in the hive or in an incubator, like described in B.)* 

### Brood rotation
- queen rearer with sufficient numbers of nurse bees can rear further batches of grafts
- each rearer can normally rear one or two btaches of 24 cells each week, continuously for several months
- for each rotation of graft, once a week the recently sealed brood below the queen excluder is moved above (and combs from which most or all brood has emerged from top down for the queen to lay eggs again)
- frame of young brood is moved up into position
- (usually one or two brood combs are rotated each week)
- (time spent searching for brood frames to move up or down is minimized by adding them otwards one end of the brood-box, and removing them from the other; after two or three weeks, a simple rotation pattern is established)

*One plan which is followed by successful breeders is to select a strong colony for cell building. Remove the cover, and put a queen excluder in its place. Then take enough frames of brood from several different colonies to fill a second brood-chamber above the excluder, leaving one vacant space. Care must be used to make sure that no queen is on the frames placed in the second story. The vacant space is left as near the center of the colony as possible, and a few hours later a frame of prepared cells is placed there, feeding the bees with syrup from the sprinkling can at the time the cells are given. If this first batch of cells is not readily accepted try again the following day. After four days a second batch can be given, and a new batch every four days thereafter. By this plan the cells are left with the colony until ready to be given to the nuclei. It only becomes necessary to add two or three frames of sealed brood every week to provide the colony with plenty of young bees for nurses, to continue cell building indefinitely. About ten to fifteen sealed cells can be secured from a single colony every four days by this plan. If a heavy honeyflow comes on, it may become necessary to add supers between the brood nest below and the cell-building chamber above, since the old queen continues to lay in normal manner below the excluder. By this method the cell-building colony will give a crop of honey as well as queens. The addition of so much brood from other colonies will keep the cell-building colony very strong throughout the season. Of course, frames of honey must be removed from time to time as frames of brood are given, and, during a good flow, it may become necessary to remove frames of honey quite often to prevent crowding in the cell-building chamber.*

## B. Initially Queen-less (starter-finisher)

### I. Basic Concepts

- The emergency response of a queen-less colony produces *many* cells — but feeds them not so well like under queen-right conditions.
- A queen-right colony finishes already started cells -- it assumes swarm or supersedure is happening.
- A queen-right colony feeds the cells better with royal jelly, leading to higher-quality queens.

We start many cells in a queen-less starter and transfer them to a queen-right finisher (above queen-excluder).
We either transfer the capped cells before emergence day to the mating nucs; or we let them emerge in roller cages in the finisher or incubator.

We can let the breeder queen lay eggs directly into cups by caging her for a day or two in a cell grid like Nicot. We plug those cups onto cell bar frame to be transferred to the starter. Or we graft ≤ 36 hours young (from hatching) larvae into cups of cell bar holder. Both Alley and Miller method transfer cutouts of comb with worker larvae to the starter and distance the future cells from each other by tapering the comb or by destroying two out of three larvae, respectively.

As the developmental stages happen (and therefore the manipulations you do) based on the age counted from the egg, it is crucial to know, meaning to control the time of egg laying.

### II. Overview of Phases & Essential Events

- day -3: prepare & insert cell grid into breeding hive
- day -1: let queen lay eggs in cell grid
- day 2-3/4: starter: let queen-less, rich in nurse bees and food starter start pulling queen cells (optimise for many cells)
- day 3/4-14/16: finisher: let queen-right colony finish cells (above queen excluder; optimise for good nourishment of cells)
- day 16: let virgin emerge in mating nuc / roller cage (in finisher or incubator)
- ≈ day 30: new queen should have mated and have started laying eggs

### III. Actions for each Phase

#### 1. Prepare Graft by either
- let queen lay eggs into cups of a cell grid (like Nicot) that you plug onto cell holder bars later
	- day -3: introduce fully prepared cell grid into breeding hive
	- day -1: cage queen into cell grid, close its plugs
	- give breeding queen 24-48 hours to lay eggs; keep her inside to not have the eggs removed by workers (if you remove her, close the grids openings with the plugs otherwise they will remove the eggs)
- transfer larvae (≤ 36 hours age, ≤3+36 hours since being laid as egg) from comb into cups to be plugged onto cell holders
- cut out comb strips and attach them to empty frame
	- Alley method: taper them to a point to distance future cells from each other
	- Miller method: destroy 2 out of 3 larvae to distance future cells from each other

#### 2. Set up Starter

- A. set up nuc as starter (42h; nuc variant):
    - shake 4 frames of nurse bees [absolutely no queen => find her in each source hive and save it!] from 4 hives into it; ideally shake them into box, let flying bees fly away
    - frames: 1 honey, 1 pollen, 1 empty or honey (to let them hang on)
    - feeder with light syrup (lighter than 1:1, for example 1:1.3)
    - add cell bars in (for 24 queen cells at a time; three batches with 48 hrs in between possible)
    - pollen pattie or add protein powder (≥ 30% protein) to syrup
    - close it (with entrances) and put it in spot with all-day shade
- B. setup Cloake board:
    - rotate bottom box to move entrance backwards
    - shake out four frames of nurse bees into a tub (without any queen!), put lid on tub
    - add top box: 1 frame of pollen, gap, 1 frame of honey, 1 frame of older > 3 days open brood [egg day 6])
    - put Cloake board on top of bottom box
    - close entrance of Cloake board, facing forward (returning foragers will find the front facing Cloake board entrance, reinforcing the top box)
    - close Cloake board insert (this makes the top box queenless hence this is now equivalent to our starter in A.)
    - put queen excluder on Cloake board
    - put top box on it
    - dump nurse bees from tub into top box
    - shake in another four to six frames of nurse bees in (no, absolutely no queen!)
    - add cell bar in gap

#### 3. Transfer cells on cell bar holder & insert into starter

- 4 hrs later: bees in starter realise they are queen less
- release queen from breeding colony from cell-grid (day 2 after caging her onto it)
- transfer plugs from cell grid to cell bars (keep warm, transport with incubator, transfer inside, do not shake bees off, instead sweep them off)
- put cell bars into it
- keep entrance closed

#### 4. Wait starter to start queen cells

- 1-2 days or couple of days, doesn’t matter
- ensure that they have continuous supply of light syrup
- once larvae have hatched from egg & they have begun to draw a cell on cup, transfer them to finisher

#### 5. Set up Finisher

- A. set up separate finisher (nuc variant)
	- take strong queen-right hive
	- put queen excluder
	- setup box on top of it, containing:
	    - frame of pollen
	    - cell bars with started cells in top box above queen excluder
	    - frame of open brood > 3 days (6 days from laid egg; yet to be capped so no competition for royal jelly but bringing nurse cells up for capping)
	    - frame of honey
	- if you no longer starter needed: dissolve it and release bees from starter into top of cell finisher
	- triple (!) check each frame in the top box to not have any queen cells, if destroy them (the finisher wouldn’t start them but would finish them for the virgin to emerge and destroy all the other cells)
B. switch Cloake board to finisher (by making it queen-right again)
- triple (!) check each frame in the top box to not have any queen cells, if destroy them (the finisher wouldn’t start them but would finish them for the virgin to emerge and destroy all the other cells)
- remove Cloake board insert (to make it queen-right again; now our hive is equivalent to finisher like in A.)

#### 6. Day 8: Cells are capped

***day 8/9: Making emergency cells impossible for mating nucs.***

- If there are larvae ≤ 36 hours age at introduction of already hatched virgin (that is on or after day 16) in the mating nuc, the mating nuc might reject the virgin and pull emergency cells instead, see notes below for background on ages.
- Therefore we don't want to have any larvae younger than 36 hours in the mating nuc on day 16.
- Adding 3 days of time for the larvae before hatching from an egg, we need to make sure that 4.5 days before day 14 there is no new egg laid on the combs we make up the.
- We achieve this by just moving the brood we select to make our mating nucs from above a queen excluder 5 days before introducing the hatched virgin, 
- How do we exclude having any larvae younger than 36 hours?  If we add 3 days of time being an egg to 36 hours young larvae, we need to make sure that 4,5 days before day 14 the queen does not lay any new eggs.
- And we do that by moving the brood we plan to make our mating nucs from on top of a queen excluder at least 5 days before making our mating nucs, which is day 13/14 - 5 = day 8, which is just the day of cells being capped.

#### Decide where to let the Virgins emerge, either:
- directly in mating nuc, requires transfer on day 14 (day 16 is emergence day)
- in roller cages (to not kill each other)
- let them emerge in finisher, in roller cages (to not kill each other)

#### 7. Day 13: Prepare Mating Nucs

- count viable queen cells
- setup sufficient number of mating nucs, each with one frame of:
    - honey
    - drown brood comb
    - 1 frame of capped brood
    - NO larvae ≤ 36 hours from hatching, see 6. how to age brood (they’d otherwise pull emergency cells from and reject the hatched virgin as she will only develop sufficient pheromones some time after she has been mated)
- entrance open, can be on same stand

#### 8. Day 14: Transfer capped Cells to Mating Nucs
- keep cell bars warm in incubator, pop only single cell each time when introducing it into single mating nuc
- hold cells only vertically

#### Day 16: Emergence Day
- by the time the virgins are few hours old, they need to be introduced with a cage (for three to four days to be accepted and released)
- after introduction of virgin or mated queen: do not open the hive, allow eggs, larvae and pheromone to develop, disturbing them at this time might have disastrous consequences, mark the date and do not touch them before.

#### Day 28: Check Virgins for Mating Success => there should be eggs

## IV. Introducing Capped Cells, Virgins and Mated Queens

### Your options to introduce them
You might:

- introduce a capped cell directly to the target hive: remove the old queen from the target hive and give it a capped queen cell (egg laying will be interrupted from hatching until virgin is mated)
- introduce the emerged virgin to the target hive
- introduce a mated queen to target hive (with older bees responsible for rejection removed and/or protected with push-in introduction cage)

### How interrupted Egg laying leads to Rejection (and how to deal with it)
- direct introduction of mated queens without protective cages into a dequeened colony works as long as egg laying of mated queen has not been interrupted (due to shipping); similarly virgins can be introduced just hours after hatching into nucs without protective cages
- a shipped queen has an interrupted egg laying, hence her pheromone profile is almost gone; this exposes her to old, aggressive workers; to protect her from them while resuming egg laying and rebuilding her pheromone profile, protect her with a push-in introduction cage (not to be confused with shipping cage), placed on emerging brood, to be released two days later

### Factors influencing Acceptance Rate:
- acceptance rate is higher during period of flow, otherwise feed
- different race than the colony entails lower acceptance rate
- the smaller the colony, the likelier the acceptance of virgin queen
- mostly older bees decide over acceptance of new queen; removing them or protecting her from them facilitates acceptance
- dark virgins have consistently low acceptance rates of 60%, the go-to-way is to introduce them with bee packages made up from young bees of multiple hives (leading to mixup of pheromones making them more tolerant)

## V. Notes

### Survival, mating nuc acceptance, mating, introduction acceptance rates

- Survival rate in incubator is 30% higher than in finisher or mating nuc, with 25% higher yield after acceptance in mating nuc 
- Higher acceptance rate for virgins emerged in mating nuc vs. introduced already hatched (as the bees might be more confrontational in the latter case).
- (Marking them before mating does not influence introduction acceptance rate for target hive unless you paint the wings).
- Mating rate of ≥80% is lower off-flow.

### Roller Cages

- the freshly hatched virgins might not be fed by nurse bees through the roller cages; they can feed themselves. Therefore make sure to put honey in the lid of the roller cages, otherwise they might starve or try to crawl back into the cells to get some remaining royal jelly at which attempt they get stuck and die (to avoid this: break down the cell after hatching); also, you might add a sponge with water for hydration.
- upon emergence in roller cages: check on them & transfer them into JZBZ cages with attendants, optionally mark / color-code them
- don’t bank virgin more than 4 days

### Larvae age to be viable as emergency cells

If one grafts the following into queen cups

- eggs: get removed
- small larvae, just barely visible: they pull queen cells from them
- larvae, visible, C-shaped: they pull queen cells from them  (≤ 36 hrs old since hatching from egg)
- larvae, almost entirely curled into O-shape: get removed

### Brother Adam's starter-finisher approach

*summarised from https://thewalrusandthehoneybee.com/making-queens-brother-adam-method/*

- add top box, fill it with ≥ 10 frames of emerging brood
- after 9 days: remove any cells in top box (and if any in lower); check by shaking off bees
- place top box on new bottom board at same location
- move former lower box to the side
- catch queen in former lower box and put it safely aside
- shake off seven frames of bees in front of new bottom (former top) box
- (leave one-frame gap to receive grafts, add empty feeder)
- give other hive queen back, move hive to another apiary and promptly feed it with sugar syrup
- grafting: find frame of hive with breeder queen with larvae twelve hours old
- cut those parts out with sharp knife, return the frame, take the larvae to the grafting shed, that is kept humid by continuously boiling a kettle
- cut comb with larvae to within 1/8th of inch of midrib with hot knife
- lift each larva out of its cell into waiting wax cups (primed with small puddle of royal jelly mixed with distilled water)
- each bar of cups take twenty larvae, three bars per frame
- put frame of sixty newly grafted young larvae into gap left in centre of cell builder, keep a finger space on each side so the bees had plenty of room to cluster around the cells
- add sugar syrup to feeder (if no good honey flow)
- leave cells ten or eleven days after grafting
