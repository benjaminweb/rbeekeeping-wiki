# Understanding Pollinator Health: Beyond Honey Bees

We noticed you're concerned about bees and their well-being. It’s great to see such enthusiasm for conservation. However, there's a common misconception we’ed like to address. While honey bees often make headlines, they are not endangered but are intensively managed agricultural animals. On the other hand, many of our native pollinators are genuinely at risk and need our attention.

Bee keepers are concerned about native pollinators in part because things that harm bees - whether a native bumble bee or an invasive Africanized hybrid honey bee - also hurt our hives. Actions that improve the safety and habitat or native bees also make our bees safer. Conservation is in our best interests, and so we support it.

## The Plight of Native Pollinators

Native pollinators, including species like butterflies, leafcutter bees, bumblebees, carpenter bees, sweat bees, miner bees, and mason bees, are facing significant threats due to pesticide use, monoculture practices, and habitat destruction. These pollinators play critical roles in our ecosystems, helping to pollinate wild plants and many crops.

Unlike honey bees, which are managed on a large scale for agricultural use, native pollinators depend heavily on diverse, natural habitats that are increasingly being diminished. The reduction in habitat not only decreases their numbers but also the genetic diversity within species, which can compromise their ability to adapt to changing environments.

## How You Can Help Native Pollinators

Creating habitats for these vital insects can significantly impact their populations and the overall health of local ecosystems. Here are a few ways you can contribute:

**Plant a Pollinator Garden:**  Choose native plants that provide nectar and pollen sources throughout the growing season. This helps ensure that there’s always food available. Include a mix of colors and shapes to attract different types of pollinators.

**Leave Some Garden Wild:** Allowing part of your garden to grow wild provides essential habitats for many native species. Leaf litter, dead wood, and tall grasses offer perfect nesting and overwintering sites.

**Install a Butterfly or Bee House:** Adding a butterfly house to your garden can provide a safe refuge for several types of pollinators. Similarly, structures like bee hotels can be beneficial for solitary bees like mason bees and leafcutter bees. These are simple to make or can be purchased ready-made.

**Avoid Pesticides:** Reducing or eliminating pesticide use in your garden can help ensure that pollinators visit safely. Consider natural pest control methods and always choose plants suited to your local conditions to minimize pest problems.

**Support Organic and Local:** When possible, support organic farms and local garden centers that promote the use of native plants and pesticide-free products. This broader approach helps reduce the demand for harmful agricultural practices that affect pollinators.

## Summary 

Addressing the needs of native pollinators is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and ecological health. While honey bees are important for agriculture, they are not at risk of extinction. Our focus should include the myriad of native species that are in critical need of conservation efforts. By taking small steps at home and in our communities, we can make a big difference in supporting these essential creatures. Let’s keep up the good work and ensure our actions contribute positively to our local ecosystems!
