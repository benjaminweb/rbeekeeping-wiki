## Bees are flying in and out of a hole in my wall, my eaves, or outbuilding.

If you've seen bees entering and exiting a space for more than a day, you have what beekeepers call a colony. Most people call a colony a "hive". You can see where the bees enter your structure, but that doesn't mean the bees are building their colony near the entrance. They could be setting up house in your attic, an interior wall, or the kitchen ceiling. Beekeepers often use thermal imaging to find where the bees are. You can look in your attic, under your shed floor, or wherever, but before you do, ask yourself if you really want to be in a dark, cramped space with twenty thousand annoyed bees.

Here's what's happening inside: the bees have started building comb. They're just doing what bees do, packing the comb full of baby bees, pollen and honey, and then making more comb for more bees and more honey. They're really good at this, and can make 50 or 100 pounds of honey in a year.

Two to three years from now, the bees will abandon the hive inside your house because of disease or parasites, just like they do in the wild. They'll leave all that yummy honey comb behind for ants and rodents -- and maybe raccoons or skunks -- to find and eat. Without the bees to control temperature and do maintenance in the abandoned colony, the comb will begin to deteriorate. One hundred pounds of honey, ants, and rodent waste will ooze through walls, ceilings, or out of electrical outlets for, well, essentially forever. This doesn't just make a horrible mess and smell awful, it can do structural damage to your home or building.


Merely exterminating the bees does not eliminate the pheromones that bees leave behind. These scents can attract new bee swarms in subsequent years, leading to a recurring problem. Proper removal of the hive and all residues ensures that the site is less attractive to future colonies.

This is why removing the colony rather than only killing the bees is important.

There's another factor: bees build quickly. The faster you act, the less cleanup there will be and the less expensive the removal will be, Do not let anyone tell you that it's okay to kill the bees and leave them there. 

We aren't saying that it isn't okay to kill the bees. It's possible that extermination before removal is the only viable option. Honey bees are not an endangered species. Unlike native pollinators, honey bees are essentially farm animals.

What we are saying is that the bees need to be removed, dead or alive. Find a local beekeeper that is experienced in "cut-outs" -- removing bees from inhabited structures -- or an exterminator experienced in bee removal. The longer you wait, the worse your problem is going to be. Check with your homeowners insurance or home warranty. One may take some of the sting out of the removal cost of removal.
