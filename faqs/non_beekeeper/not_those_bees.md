# Save the bees!

Just, not those bees...

## Rethinking Honeybees: Agricultural Tools, Not Conservation Heroes

We love honey bees. They're fascinating insects that pollinate our crops and gardens, make honey and wax, and provide leisure activities or livelihoods for many of us. Honeybees are not, however, an endangered species - they are farm animals.  Recent findings from Cambridge researchers challenge the conventional wisdom surrounding honeybees and their role in environmental conservation. The narrative that we need to "save the honeybees" might be misleading and detracts from more pressing ecological concerns.

## Managed Honeybees vs. Wild Pollinators: A Crucial Distinction

Honeybees are essentially the livestock of the insect world. As Juan P. Gonz√°lez-Varo from Cambridge points out, they are "artificially-bred agricultural animals," managed much like cattle or pigs. Despite public concern, the decline in honeybee populations primarily reflects agricultural challenges, not a direct conservation issue. These bees are continually bred and managed, which differentiates them from truly endangered species.

## Adverse Effects on Wild Pollinators

The conservation efforts focused on increasing honeybee populations in urban and protected areas might be counterproductive. Dr. Jonas Geldmann of Cambridge highlights a troubling issue: these well-intentioned initiatives can actually harm biodiversity by enabling honeybees to outcompete and spread diseases to their wild counterparts. These wild pollinators are the real victims of an overlooked biodiversity crisis.

## The Spillover Effect and its Consequences

Honeybees, active nearly year-round, pose a significant problem when cultivated crops cease blooming. They migrate to natural habitats, competing with indigenous pollinators for scarce resources. Research from southern Spain reveals that after agricultural blooms like those of orange trees, honeybee populations in nearby woodlands can surge to levels eight times their normal size, drastically out-competing native pollinators.

## A Call for Clear Distinctions in Conservation Strategies

The current approach to boosting honeybee numbers for crop pollination inadvertently undermines the survival of wild pollinators. Both groups are affected by pesticides and habitat loss, but conservation efforts disproportionately favor managed honeybees over their wild counterparts, whose ecological roles are equally if not more crucial.
 
The plight of honeybees, while significant, should not obscure the broader ecological crisis facing wild pollinators. Effective conservation strategies must prioritize ecological balance, recognizing the distinct roles of managed and wild pollinators. It's imperative to realign our efforts to reflect the nuanced realities of pollinator health and biodiversity.
