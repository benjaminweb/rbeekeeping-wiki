# Is this the queen? A drone? A worker?

> I think I saw my queen, but I'm not sure.  How do I know which bee is which?

## 1. Worker Bees

Your hive is mostly full of thousands upon thousands of these, so they're a good baseline.  Pick a random bee and it's almost certainly a worker.  They all look about the same, though note that newly-emerged workers will usually be paler and almost silky-looking.  That's normal, they'll darken up as they age.   

## 2. Drones

Drones are MUCH fatter and a bit longer than workers, almost like bumblebees.  The other defining characteristic is their eyes - drones have HUGE round eyes that cover most of their head and meet in the middle.  Workers' eyes are much smaller and more separated.

Colonies do not keep drones around all the time, but they can be very abundant during the active season.  As males, their only job is to mate with a queen... otherwise they're total mooches.  So strong, healthy colonies can support a lot of them to help get their genetics out into the world.  In temperate areas, they will be evicted in advance of winter as the foraging season ramps down, and will usually start being reared again once spring starts to warm up.

## 3. The Queen

It's common for new keepers to mistake a drone for the queen at first, but she's again very very distinctive if you know what to look for.  A mature queen isn't much broader than a worker, so way less fat than a drone.  THe most distinctive characteristic is her long, distended abdomen that is usually orange in color.  She also has a prominent black "shield" in the middle of her thorax, with the wings well to either side.  This is the spot that you paint when marking a queen (which can make your life a lot easier).  Worker bees have this shield too, but it's much smaller and partially obscured by the wings.  

Be aware that virgin queens are a whole lot harder to distinguish from workers.  They don't yet have that fully distended abdomen; it's still longer than that of a worker, but not nearly as obviously so.  It will gradually elongate as she matures and begins to lay.
