# I think I see a queen cell!  What do I do???

## I. How to identify Queen Cells
>The same standard-sized cells are used to hold nectar/honey, pollen/bee bread, and worker brood.  If you see a cell or section of comb that looks distinctly different, it's likely to be one of three things:

### 1. Drone Cells
Drones are larger than worker bees, so their larval cells need to be too.  Drone cells are both wider and longer than worker cells... a capped worker cell will have a nice flat cover, while a drone cell will bulge WAY out of the frame in a domed "bullet" shape.    

If you use foundation, the cell pattern does NOT fit drone cell well.  Consequently, bees tend to make lots of drone comb around the edges of a frame, hanging underneath on burr comb, or anyplace else they can find room.  When they do make drone comb on foundation, it may appear irregular and at odd angles - again just because they're fitting a square peg into a round hole.  

Drone comb is normal during much of the season, and if anything indicates a nice strong colony.  However there are reasons you may decide to control your drone population (resource management, mite control, etc.).  There is also specially-sized drone foundation available, it at least encourages them to put most of their drones in one spot without making a mess.  

### 2. Queen Cups

Queen cups or "play cups" are a round, marble-sized cell protruding out from the face of the comb.  These are the precursors to queen cells... all queen cells will start out as queen cups, however NOT all queen cups will become queen cells.  

It's like this, see - queen cups are totally normal.  Almost all colonies will keep a couple around all the time, they don't necessarily indicate anything.  They are there just in case... in the event that a colony DOES need to make a queen, well they've got a spot all ready to go.  As such, there is no routine reason to knock them down.  They don't mean a colony is going to requeen or swarm, and if they are then removing queen cups won't change their mind.  

It's fine to remove them if there's a reason... "wait, is that the same cell I checked last time?  Let me just squish it and see if they rebuild one next time."  They also may tell you things... for example, if you have a strong overwintered colony, AND it's swarm season in your area, AND a dozen queen cups show up all at once along the bottom of a frame... ok, that may well be an indicator (among several others) that your bees are thinking about swarming.  Like so much else, it's all about context.

When in doubt, peek inside the cup.  If there's no egg, there no reason for concern.  Sometimes a queen will even deposit an egg in there on her normal rounds, but the nurse bees will go "not on my watch" and pull it right back out.  Now, if you see a developing larva in there, that's what's called a "loaded" or "charged" queen cup, which is on its way to becoming a full queen cell.  Now we have a whole different story.  

### 3. Queen Cells

Once a queen cup is charged with a developing larvae, now we can just think of it as a full-fledged queen cell.  Queen cells are very distinctive, as the bees will elongate them as the queen larva grows.  A full sized queen cell will look a lot like a peanut shell and is nearly the same size, much longer than little round queen cups.  They can be on the face of a comb or hanging underneath it, but will always protrude downward.  Drone cells protrude out horizontally, not down, and are MUCH smaller.

## II. So you have a Queen Cell... what now???

There is a whole lot of "it depends" here.  The one thing to understand is that at the point you have a developing queen cell, removing it will probably NOT address the underlying reason it is there, and the bees will likely try again.  But don't panic!  Take a moment, think about what's going on and why.  Queen cells appear in three contexts:

### 1. Emergency Queens
If a colony finds themselves queenless, they will rear a new one.  They can only do this with eggs or very young larvae, less than 3 days old.  So if they don't have any, you'll either need to give them a frame with some eggs from another hive (one of many reasons having more than one hive is beneficial) or introduce a queen or queen cell.  But as long as they have the brood for it, the bees have this situation under control.  

Any time you are allowing a hive to requeen, the best practice is to cull any queen cells (sometimes they make a LOT) down to the nicest-looking 2 or 3 that are close together and ideally on the same frame.  Scrape off and squish the rest, though they can always be grafted into another colony that needs a queen.  The reason to cull is that the first queen to emerge will *normally* murder the rest... but the more there are, the more likely she is to miss a couple.  Multiple queens emerging can lead to fights or repeated mini (or "cast") swarms, neither of which you want.  After culling the extra cells, treat the hive as normal and expect to see eggs about two weeks after the queen cell was capped, give or take a few days.

### 2. Supersedure
This is much like making an emergency queen, except the original one isn't dead yet.  There is just something about her that the colony doesn't like, so they're preparing her replacement.  Once the virgin returns from her mating flight and begins laying, the original queen will *usually* die or be killed soon after.  This is *extremely* common among packages, which tend to supersede in the first season more often than not (probably because the bees are not all related to the queen).  If you remove the supersedure cells, they *may* decide to accept the queen as more of her genetic relatives populate the hive, or they may try again.  Mature colonies will supersede an established queen as she becomes less productive with age, gets sick, etc. and should more likely be allowed to replace her.  In either case, allowing a supersedure to proceed is just fine.

If you do let your colony supersede, deal with those cells exactly as above for Emergency Queens.  

### 3. Swarming
Learning how to recognize the signs of swarm preparation, understanding its process and timing, and controlling it via splitting are critical skills for a successful beekeeper.  Those are also all much longer discussions covered in detail elsewhere.  But in brief, to recognize it:

Swarm cells are regular queen cells, just for the specific purpose of swarming.  They will most often appear hanging below a frame (but can be anywhere) and can be quite numerous.  You "might* be able to dissuade a colony from swarming if caught early enough, but once swarm cells appear it has to be dealt with by splitting.  Understand that even if you keep removing all the swarm cells, they will make more but then may eventually just take off anyway... now you're left with no queen and maybe no way to make more.  That's bad.  Timning is also critical - the swarm usually departs right around when the first queen cell is capped (9 days from when the egg is laid), so you must act before then.  

Yet again cull swarm cells down to just 2-3 close together, and split the hive.  There are many variations on how to do so; see ***.  Note that to satisfy the swarm instinct, the original queen has to be moved into the new split and the queen cells left in the parent hive, not the other way around.
