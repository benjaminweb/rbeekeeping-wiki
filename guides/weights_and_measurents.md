# Weights and Measurements

Below are rough estimates of the weight of honey stored in various frame sizes for diffreent hive types. 

These are ballparks are purposefully lowballed for the purposes of optimism / pessimism... whichever way you look at it.

## Syrups

Syrup can be made using weights of volumes. It largely doesn't matter. However, weights are easier - if you buy 5kg of sugar, you need 5L of water.

Standard recipe for syrup is as follows, and give you the resulting syrup amount, so as to be helpful in terms of provisioning backwards.

| Ratio | Sugar | Water | Syrup   |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 2:1   | 10 kg | 5 L   | 11-12 L |
| 1:1   | 10 kg | 10 L  | 16-17 L |
| 10:13 | 10 kg | 13 L  | 20 L    |

## British Standard National

| Frame Size       | Full frame  | Full box  |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Deep (14x12)     | 4 kg        | 30 kg     |
| Standard (brood) | 2 kg        | 25 kg     |
| Shallow (super)  | 1 kg        | 20 kg     |

> ⚠️ These weights are for a "standard use case". That is to say, 14x12 and brood boxes being used as brood, and not honey supers. These weights will also vary dramatically depending on the number of frames, the amount of honey vs brood etc. If you are using standard brood frames as honey supers, the weight of this will be far higher. Closer to (if not above) 30kg than 25. Do not try and lift a 14x12 box full of honey/stores if you don't go to the gym.

## Langstroth

| Frame Size       | Full Frame   | Full 8-Frame Box | Full 10-Frame Box |
|----------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------   |
| Deep	           | 8 lbs        | 64 lbs           | 80 lbs            |
| Medium	       | 5 lbs        | 40 lbs           | 50 lbs            |
| Shallow          | 4 lbs        |	32 lbs           | 40 lbs            |
