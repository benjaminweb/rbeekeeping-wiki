This wiki is maintained by the community of [r/Beekeeping](https://reddit.com/r/Beekeeping). We are an online global community of beekeepers who want to help other beekeepers by providing help and our lived experience through interaction on Reddit, and through curated easy-to-follow guides in this wiki. If you want help, or want to give help, then [r/Beekeeping](https://reddit.com/r/Beekeeping) is the place for you. 

This wiki contains curated and community reviewed guides and information for beekeepers and non-beekeepers alike. 

**Warning:** This is currently a work in progress - There's lots of pages that aren't complete, broken links, and typos. If you wish to help make it better, scroll to the bottom of the page.
