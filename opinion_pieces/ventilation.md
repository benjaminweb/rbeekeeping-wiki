> # Ventiliation
> The bees are remarkably good at ventilating the hives themselves. They don't need help

The concensus on ventilation in hives changes like the wind. There are strong opinions about ventilation, and I can understand why. There's lots of right ways to keep bees, but ventilation is something that is well studied and presents lots of problems if it is mismanaged. Some examples of this are:

- Bearding
- Cooling
- Moisture management
- Winter moisture / condensation concerns
- CO2 trapping
- Predation / Robbing

I'll address these concerns one by one so that you can get a perspective of why *adding* ventilation is a bad idea. Before we do that, we'll cover the fundamentals of in-hive environment management from the ground up first so you can apply these ideas to each of the problems above.

Firstly, when it comes to moisture and humidity, the bees enjoy a nice warm and humid environment to prevent brood dessicating. The bees maintain this humidity by bringing water into the hive and evaporating it off, or by simply breathing. The former of these is also how the bees maintain exceptionally consistent in-hive temperatures too. They can opt to dislocate their wing muscles and spasm to produce heat, or they can bring water into the hive and evaporate the water to cool the air. 

Secondly, bee colonies *breathe*. They push air in and out of the hive at roughly 3 "breaths" per minute during the day, and 1 "breath" every 2 minutes at night. 

Thirdly, bees trap CO2 inside the hive. There are competing theories as to why, but we know that they intentionally reduce the amount of available oxygen inside the hive. The going theory for this is that it helps to reduce the metabolic pace of the bees, slowing ageing, and reducing the amount of stores and energy required to maintain the hive.

Lastly, we know that bees *prefer* an entrace of 15 square centimeters. 

On this note, lets discuss each problem one by one...

## Bearding

We sometimes see a beard of bees outside of the colony and think "oh boy". This is the wrong thought to have. Bearding bees are not exposing themselves to the elements for no reason. They are clearing a bit of space to make room for air to flow through the colony as *they* see fit. It is not something that is problematic for them, and moving bees outside of the hive to create channels for air is perfectly normal. It might be argued that bearding is a *good* sign, as the bees are happy maintaining their hive environment as they see fit. 

No efforts need to be made to prevent bearding unless there are other concerns such as hive congestion.

## Temperature Management

Knowing that the bees like to bring water into the hive to cool it down, why would we remove the entrance reducer and allow all that cold air to rush out of the colony? Knowing that the colony intentionally pumps air in and out of the hive, there is no need to remove an entrance reducer to increase ventilation. The bees are more than capable of cooling their hive, and creating channels for air to flow through inside the hive.

A simile of what this might look like for us is turning on air conditioning in the house, and then opening the windows to make sure we get plenty of fresh air in. If the air outside of the house is 35Â°C, and we open the windows, all we're doing is letting cold air leave more quickly than we can produce it. Likewise, letting the bees ventilate their hive of their own accord and allowing them to maintain the temperature inside the hive as they see fit is a better approach. This means leaving the entrance reducer in the hive and letting them bring water to the colony for cooling, and trapping that cool air insie the hive. 

The efficacy of entrance reduers on cooling was made no clearer to us as a community than when one of our users reported the inside of their hive melting in the arizona heat, killing the colony. After adding entrance reducers to their hives, they had no more issues maintaining the temperature of the hive, and had no more meltdowns. 

## Moisture Management / Winter Condensation

You'll sometimes hear beekeepers say that moisture inside the hive will kill a colony during winter. This is simply not true, or at least it's not true in a colony with well managed thermal insulation. In recent years there has been a significant shift away from "ventilated" hives to "condensing" hives for winter. Ventilated hives usually have a top entrance that allows for hot humid air to leave the colony, and cold and drier air to enter through the bottom. Condensing hives allow water to condense in places that won't be problematic. We'll discuss this in more detail, because it's really important to understand how winter condensation kills bees.

When a colony is unable to fly due to low temperatures, moisture builds up inside the hive until it starts condensing on the inside of the hive. The one time when this presents an issue with regards to killing bees is when moisture condenses on the ceiling of the hive. When it does, it drips down onto the colony, thus chilling the bees, causing them to go torpid and then succumb to the cold. Where this is *not* a problem is on the walls of the hive and on the floor. 

We sometimes find that insulation can cause problem for our own houses too. Where we have a house that has been recently insulated with brand new insulation, we can get moisture problems. This is because moisture that *was* condensing in places where it was not problematic before now has to find different places to condense. Rather than previous where moisture condensed across the entire wall in a barely percievable film, we now have a tiny patch of cold where the insulation is slightly thinner, and now where all of that water is now condensing, thus producing a damp patch and mold. This is why reinsulating a house needs to be carefully planned to make sure that moisture is properly managed and doesn't present *new* problems.

As such, the advice we would normally give to beekeepers going into winter is simple: insulate your ceiling twice as much as the walls. The walls will be colder than the ceiling, causing the moisture to condense there, keeping the ceiling dry enough that it doesn't drip down onto the bees. Some environments do not need as much insulation as others. In the UK, insulating only the crown board is usually sufficient enough to keep the colony warm and keep moisture on the walls. If you are using an OMF, water will be able to drip down the walls onto the OMF and leave the colony. People with closed bottom boards may need to lean their hives slightly forwards to prevent water pooling in the back of the hive and rotting the woodenware. 

There's some theory amongst condensing hive users that moisture inside the hive can be beneficial for the bees during winter. On days where it's warm enough for them to break cluster but not fly, they have a ready supply of water inside the hive and can use that water to dilute down honey that has granulated in the cells. 

With regards to moisture management in summer, just know that the bees like a fairly high humidity inside the hive. We do not need to help them manage this. They can ventilate the hive more aggressively to vent off moisture, or bring water in should they need it. 

Wild hives are a little more fortunate in regards to moisture because the tree they live in will help wick moisture away. They also have an insualted roof by default, meaning moisture will naturally condense on the walls of the tree regardless. 

## Robbing

Nothing is more apparent as to the benefits of an entrance reducer than when you see a colony being robbed. Robbing tends to, for most of us, come from two soures: bees, and wasps. Let us clear one thing up before we continue: Wasps are not predators - they are scavengers. When they are brooding, they are fed by larvae in their nest whenever they bring back protein for them to eat. This secretion is a sugary solution produced by the larvae. At the end of the season when they are brooding down ready to hibernate for winter, the amount of food they get is reduced and they begin to starve. Starvation forces them to make decisions they otherwise never would, and one of those is to invade a colony of 40,000-60,000 bees to *try* and get to their stores. 

During dearths, bees from other colonies might go on the hunt for weaker colonies to steal from. All it takes is one bee to get in, steal some stores, and head back home... one they report the site of a hive with no entrance reducer and limited guards, they come back in droves to take whatever they can get their proboscis on. 

An entrance reducer is not only designed to help maintain the hive environment, but also to reduce the amount of space needed to guard. This allows the colony to vet each individual attempting to get into the colony, and evict those who they do not recognise. By leaving out the entrance reduer, we increase the space needed to guard, making it impossible for them to maintain this level of security. 

Lastly, there is the mention of the dreaded Asian Hornet (Vespa velutina, or VV). VV are tremendous at detecting apiaries by smell and hawking the front of the hive. When we leave the open mesh floor open, and leave the entrance reducer out, we increase the available scent for them to find... like sending up a flair for them to head towards. One of the first lines of defense for protecting your hives against asian hornets is to reduce the scent of the apiary by closing up all vents on the hive aside from the entrance (with an entrance reducer in, obviously).

# Conclusion

The best thing you can do for your bees is keep their ventilation to a minimum. Try to keep their entrance to 15 square centimeters, and maybe a little smaller in winter or during robbing seasons. Keep the OMF closed, or use a closed bottom board. Insulate the ceiling of the hive at least twice as much as the walls. These things will allow the bees to maintain the own hive environmet, and keep moisture and temperature well under control.
